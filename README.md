# Binpacking Algorithms
Comparative analysis of the [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) vs. [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) for the binpacking problem.
Dictionaries of `(object_name, object_size)` of different sizes (50, 100, 200 and 400 items) were used as input.
